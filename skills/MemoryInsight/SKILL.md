A factual finding — something learned from experience that future-self can act on without re-reading the original session.

Read the template at the configured `template` path before creating the file. Replace Templater placeholders (`{{title}}`, `{{date:...}}`) with actual values.

Write to `memory/insights/` using the title as filename. Tag with `type/memory/insight`. The `origin` field records where the learning came from. The `insight` field is one sentence — the reusable finding.
